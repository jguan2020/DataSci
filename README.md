Performs KNN and Naive Bases algorithms on predicting total CO2 emissions per country based on agricultural land area, forest area, and terrestrial marine protected areas. 

Data is compiled of 192 countries split into 150 countries for training and 42 for testing.
K nearest neighbors and gaussian naive bayes learning algorithms were applied and performance was compared between each.

Results: Both algorithms had similar performances at about 85% accuracy in test predictions on average, ranging from 80-95% each. Similarity in predictions was very high with about 95-100% similar predictions on average.

Data was compiled from Kaggle using the dataset "Global Environmental Indicators" by Sazidul Islam.
Data from agricultural land area was from 2015, data from forest area was from 2015, data from CO2 emissions was from 2015, and data from terrestrial marine protected areas was from 2018.
